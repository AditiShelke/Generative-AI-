Power Pivot and the Data Model

Power Pivot operates within a Data Model, where relationships are established and managed. This approach permits the creation of a PivotTable from multiple sources without physically merging them.

Making use of the DAX formula language, Power Pivot handles intricate calculations on the data model, spanning time intelligence, rankings, percentiles, and more.

A major advantage lies in Power Pivot’s ability to efficiently manage numerous data sources. It doesn’t necessitate storing a memory-intensive “Frankentable” and computes DAX measures as needed. However, mastering Power Pivot can prove challenging due to its steep learning curve, particularly when dealing with data sources not consolidated into a single table.

On the sales_pp worksheet of ch_06.xlsx, I have created a Data Model consisting of the three sales data sources and loaded the results to a PivotTable. Now I am able to analyze and calculate based across all related tables, as shown in Figure 6-3.
